## What is Github?

#### version control

Whenever you have a bunch of code and things stop working.

Idea is you make something, i'm checkpointing it now and save a copy.

This copy is a **Git**

Everyone uses for verison control

<https://github.com>

Lets you save all your **Gits**

Its like **Git** on the cloud

Go to...

<https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop>

Built somehting that lets you use Google Spreadsheets as a database

With Github you put your code up and as long as its publuc anyone can contribute to it


<https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop/blob/master/src/tabletop.js>

New version is called a 'commit'

So many people have contributed, that really make Github valuable

If I want to make my own version, click 'fork' now have a repository of their code

You make your own version and submit it as a 'pull request'

they can choose to accept it

Github make money, you have to pay them to have a private repository

Prose.io connects to github
